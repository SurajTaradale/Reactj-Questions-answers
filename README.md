  <h3>1. What is ReactJs ?</h3>
  <p>ReactJs  is declarative, efficient, and flexible   JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
  <p>It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies</p>
  <p>React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality
</p>
   <p>It came into existence in 2011, when Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook created the library.</p>
  <p>The first use case of React was in Facebookâ€™s newsfeed in 2011. Later on, it is picked up by Instagram to use it in their system.</p>
  <p>With time, React grew, and Facebook decided to make it open source in May 2013 at JSConf US. In 2015 JSConf, React Native was announced which enabled easy development with Android and IOS development. In the same year, React Native was open-sourced to help it grow.</P>

  <h3>2. Name some advantages of React.</h3>
  <p><b>Intuitive : </b>ReactJS is extremely intuitive to work with and provides interactivity to the layout of any UI.  it enables fast and quality assured application development that in turn saves tome for both - clients and developers.</p>
    <p><b>Declarative : </b>ReactJS enables significant data changes that result in automatic alteration in the selected parts of user interfaces. there is no additional function that you need to perform to update your user interface.</p>
      <p><b>Provides	Reusable	Components : </b>ReactJS provides reusable components that developers have the authority to reuse and create a new application . Reusability is exactly like a remedy for developers. This platform gives the developers the authority to reuse the components build for some other application having the same functionality. Thereby, reducing the development effort and ensuring a flawless performance.</p>
  <p><b>JavaScript library : </b>A strong blend of JavaScript and HTML syntax is always used, which automatically simplifies the entire process of writing code for the planned project. The JS library consists several functions including one that converts the HTML components into required functions and transforms the entire project so that it is easy to understand. </p>

  <h3>3. What is JSX ?</h3>
  <p>JSX is a JavaScript Extension Syntax used in React to easily write HTML and JavaScript together.</p>
        <p> This is simple JSX code in React. But the browser does not understand this JSX because it's not valid JavaScript code. This is because we're assigning an HTML tag to a variable that is not a string but just HTML code.
So to convert it to browser understandable JavaScript code, we use a tool like Babel which is a JavaScript compiler/transpiler.</p>
